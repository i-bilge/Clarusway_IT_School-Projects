1. Planing to create 2 components => Form, Contacts
2. Will use material UI for the UI Layout and components
3. Will use Firebase realtime database to store the data (CRUD)

Production steps
1. Create the form component.
2. See if you can console log the form inputs correctly.
3. Create a firebase database.
4.Send the data to the database. (C)
5. Read the data from the database and console log it. (R)
6. Create contacts component
7. Time to state management 
    a. 3 fields => different useStates or a single useState
8. Do not repeat yourself => create a handleChange function
9.TIME FOR FIREBASE
10. Create a web app => create a firestore db => initilaize it 
11. db => collections(users, friends, messages) => documents(Omer, Henry, Daniel, Ismail)
12. C => okay Create
12. R => okay Read
13. DataGrid component matches column field value inside row
14. Edit and Delete Column
15. In order to reset the inputs, added value attribute to them
16. I need to have access setUSerInfo from COntacts, so I lifted the state to the App component

Material UI Notes
1. styling can be done via sx props
2. TextField for input fields
3. Select for dropdown
4. Simple container like div => Box
5. We need to install mui icons seperately 

TODO: 
1. ADD ERROR MESSAGE (SNACKBAR AND ALERT IN MATERIL UI)
2. ADD A NEW COLUMN FOR CREATED
3. ADD A NEW COLUMN FOR UPDATED IF THERE IS AN UPDATED
4. A CONFIRMATION MODAL BEFORE DELETING (LOOK FOR DIALOG COMPONENT IN MUI)
